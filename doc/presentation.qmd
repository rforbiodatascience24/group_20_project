## Introduction{.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

#### Aim

Investigating hepatic gene expression by comparing expression levels across:

  - Healthy individuals  
  - Patients with NAFLD  
  - Patients with cirrhosis

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
#### Data

- **RNA-seq**: from patients with NAFLD, patients with cirrhosis, and healthy controls under both fasting and postprandial conditions
- **Meta data**: additional information about patients

**RNA-seq** of human liver biopsies from patients with NAFLD, patients with cirrhosis, and healthy controls under both fasting and postprandial conditions

 **Meta data** containing additional information about the patients.

::: notes
We did some data processing in the form of cleaning and augmenting of the data, before using it for analysis.

The meta data was cleaned by removing duplicate rows and columns and by removing unnecessary columns from the data set. Then the column names were changed to make more sense.

From the clean data set we removed excluded patients and then by comparing to the count data we only kept the data for patients that were included in both data sets.

::: notes
The raw count data consists of 31 files, one file per patient. These files were merged together to form one data set including the data for all the patient.

The cleaned count data was then transformed from the long format to the wide and while doing so we created 2 different data sets, one with the count data and one with the normalised count data.

The (normalised) count data was then compared to the meta data so we only kept the data for patients that were included in both data sets. Then we removed rows that weren’t different from zero. and added two new columns with the gene IDs and gene symbols related to the transcript IDs in the data set.

Lastly the column names were changed.

## Descriptive analysis{.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="35%"}

<br>

- Distributions are fairly equal throughout our data
- Sick people are older on average 
- No significance in disease between men and women

## Gene Set Enrichment Analysis{.smaller}


:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="35%"}

<br>

Investigating hepatic gene set enrichment

<br>

- C11 hepatocytes is a subtype of hepatocytes (1 of 3) 
- Hepatocytes produces hepatokines (hormone involved in metabolic regulation) 
- Some therapies try to promote hepatocyte regeneration
