## Introduction

- **Aim**: Investigating hepatic gene expression by comparing expression levels across:  
  - Healthy individuals  
  - Patients with NAFLD
  - Patients with cirrhosis  
- **Goal**: Identify key differences linked to disease progression. 
- **Impact:**: Insights could guide early diagnosis, therapeutic targets, and personalized treatment strategies.
- **Data**: RNA-seq of human liver biopsies from patients with NAFLD, patient with cirrhosis, and healthy controls under both fasting and postprandial conditions
